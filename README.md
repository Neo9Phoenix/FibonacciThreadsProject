A **Java program** demonstrating **multithreading** by computing Fibonacci numbers using two different approaches:
- 🌀 Recursive computation (inefficient but classic)
- ⚡ Dynamic programming computation (optimized iterative)

---

## 🧩 Features
- Parallel execution of both algorithms using threads  
- Performance comparison between recursive and dynamic methods  
- Timing metrics displayed for each computation  

---

## ⚙️ How to Run

### 1️⃣ Make sure you have Java 21 (or newer) installed.  
You can verify by running:
```bash
java -version
```

2️⃣ Compile the program
javac FibonacciThreads.java

3️⃣ Run the program
java FibonacciThreads

🧮 Example Output
Recursive Fibonacci result for n = 40 is: 102334155
Recursive computation took 1851 ms

Dynamic Fibonacci result for n = 40 is: 102334155
Dynamic computation took 0 ms
